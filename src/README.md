# dirsweeper

**dirsweeper** is a command-line tool for managing and transforming directory structures using `.broom` instruction files. It provides a simple, declarative syntax for creating, renaming, moving, and deleting files or directories â€” including support for regular expressions.

## .broom Syntax

Each instruction is written on a new line. You can use either long or short command names:

| Command    | Alias | Description                  |
|------------|-------|------------------------------|
| `new`      | `n`   | Create a directory           |
| `rename`   | `rn`  | Rename files or directories  |
| `move`     | `m`   | Move files or directories    |
| `delete`   | `d`   | Delete files or directories  |

Use `-r` for regex-based commands.

---

### Example

```
# Create folders
new src/
new dist/

# Rename files with a pattern
rename -r ^old_(.*)$ new_$1

# Move all logs to archive
move -r logs/(.*\.log)$ archive/$1

# Delete all contents of the temp folder
delete -r ^temp/.*
```

---

## Preview

By default, `apply` previews the changes it would make:

```
dirsweeper apply structure.broom
```

To actually make the changes:

```
dirsweeper apply structure.broom -y
```

To apply and keep the `.broom` file:

```
dirsweeper apply structure.broom -y -keep
```
